These signatures can be used on interface policies and transit policies to protect the FortiGate control plane and devices behind the FortiGate firewall, respectively. For more information on using IPS signatures, refer to the documentation.Note that while many products are vulnerable to CVE-2014-0224, interception of communications requires that both client and server are vulnerable. All mainstream browsers do not utilize OpenSSL and are thus not affected.Firmware UpdatesFortinet is making every effort to produce software fixes for these vulnerabilities.
