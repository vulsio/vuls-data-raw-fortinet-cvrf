Workarounds: FortiAnalyzer: One can restrict access to the administration interfaces (including SSH access) to a minimal set of authorized IP addresses, via the trusthost commands. FortiSwitch: Disable admin access via SSH on all interfaces, and use the Web GUI instead, or the console applet of the GUI for CLI access. FortiCache: Disable admin access via SSH on all interfaces, and use the Web GUI instead, or the console applet of the GUI for CLI access. If management by a FortiManager device is not needed, the following CLI commands disable access with the undocumented account: config system central-management set type fortiguard end FortiOS: Disable admin access via SSH on all interfaces, and use the Web GUI instead, or the console applet of the GUI for CLI access. On 5.0 and 4.3, if SSH access is mandatory, one can restrict access to SSH to a minimal set of authorized IP addresses, via the Local In policies. On 4.2 and 4.1, if SSH access is mandatory, one can restrict access to the administration interfaces (including SSH access) to a minimal set of authorized IP addresses, via the trusthost commands.
