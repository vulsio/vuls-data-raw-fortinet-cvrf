The latter type of packets generally consumes more CPU to be processed than the \"traditional\" ICMP packets used in classical ping-flood attacks (Type 8 Code 0). As such, Blacknurse aims at exhausting the target's CPU, rather than its bandwidth (so called \"low-bandwidth attack\").\n        ",

Then choose the interface, src address, dst address, service and set the ICMP_FLOOD button to \"Block\".FortiDDoS will also protect itself or devices sitting behind it, automatically (see https://blog.fortinet.com/2016/11/14/black-nurse-ddos-attack-power-of-granular-packet-inspection-of-fortiddos-with-unpredictable-ddos-attacks for more details).\n        ",
