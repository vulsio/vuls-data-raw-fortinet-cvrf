Choose digital signature authentication (RSA authentication with Certificates) instead of Pre-Shared Key in IKE authentication. This effectively prevents the attack completely.2. If the above is not acceptable given the environment, and Pre-Shared Key has to be chosen, a minimum of 12 high-entropy random ASCII characters should be used as the key (with 20 characters being preferable). This renders the attack unpractical in the current state of computing power available for brute-force cracking.\n        ",
