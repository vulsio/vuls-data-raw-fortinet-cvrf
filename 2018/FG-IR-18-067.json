It targets the \"branch prediction\" operations â€”which is the same part of a CPU speculative execution process as the one targeted by \"Spectre variant 2\". However, while \"Spectre 2\" exploits the Branch Target Buffer (BTB), BranchScope exploits the Directional Branch Predictor (DBP).\n        ",

We are not aware of such a vulnerability on the aforementioned products. To reduce the possibility of the existence of a \"local or remote code execution vulnerability\" (as referred to above), upgrading to our latest publicly available software version is recommended.

FortiOS users can check the CPU model of their unit by running the following CLI command: # get hardware status Model name: FortiGate-XXX CPU: {CPU model info} If the CPU model info is not among the processors mentioned above, then the risk for the FortiGate appliance is even lower.
