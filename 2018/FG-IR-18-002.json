Thus Meltdown/Spectre attacks and their variants are only possible if the attack is combined with an additional local or remote code execution vulnerability, unrelated to these two issues - Meltdown and Spectre can then aggravate the situation, if such vulnerabilities exist and are successfully exploited.\n        ",

				"text": "\n            To reduce the risk of being exposed to a Meltdown/Spectre class vulnerability and reduce the possibility of an \"already existing local or remote code execution vulnerability\", upgrading to our latest publicly available software version is recommended. Due to the fact the OS kernel patch, by nature, slows the performance down, and considering the low risk, OS kernel patches may be produced and update details, if have any, will be given in product release notes. Please note that in any case, any vulnerability (Local code execution or remote code execution) that would enable the exploitability of Spectre/Meltdown class vulnerabilities will always be treated as a high/critical severity vulnerability, and swiftly fixed. Mitigation Customers are suggested to upgrade to the following listed branches and versions (newer branches preferred): FortiOS upgrade to 5.6.3, 6.0.0 or newer versions FortiAP upgrade to 5.6.5, 6.0.2 or newer versions FortiSwitch upgrade to 3.6.3, 4.0.0 or newer versions FortiAnalyzer upgrade to 5.6.6, 6.0.2 or newer versions Update History 01-04-2018 Initial version. 01-18-2018 Final assessment. 05-22-2018 Remove other vendors (Microsoft Windows/VMware) patch info. 05-22-2018 Included variant v3a, v4 and Spectre-ng vulnerabilities. 07-12-2018 Included LazyFP, variant v1.1 and v1.2 08-01-2018 Included SpectreRSB and NetSpecture 08-16-2018 Included BranchScope, Foreshadow and Foreshadow-NG 11-22-2018 Added product mitigation suggestions. 05-24-2019 Included Intel ZombieLoad Side-Channel Attacks 08-26-2019 Included SWAPGS Spectre Side-Channel Vulnerability\n        ",
