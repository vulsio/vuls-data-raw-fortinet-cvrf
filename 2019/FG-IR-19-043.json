This upgrading issue does not impact FortiOS VM models and is addressed in FortiOS 6.2.4. To verify the operation succeeded, set self-sign as admin webUI server certificate and read the cert detail through the web browser - the CN should be \"FortiGate\" instead the SN of the FortiGate device. * Application Control Violation error message Information Disclosure: Upgrade to FortiOS 5.6.6, 6.0.2 or later versions Workarounds: * HTTP Server Header Information Disclosure: Limit admin web portal access to local network only. * Admin web portal builtin certificate Information Disclosure: Upload and use a 3rd party signed certificate as admin web portal server certificate or Limit admin web portal access to local network only. * Application Control Violation error message Information Disclosure: Refer to https://fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-18-085 Revision History: 2019-03-29 Initial release 2019-10-17 Fix the admin webUI builtin certificate SN leak issue.\n        ",
