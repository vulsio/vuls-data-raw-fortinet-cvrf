				"text": "\n            CVE-2019-11477: The Linux kernel is vulnerable to an integer overflow in the 16 bit width of TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. CVE-2019-11478: The Linux kernel is vulnerable to a flaw that allows attackers to send a crafted sequence of SACKs which will fragment the TCP retransmission queue. An attacker might be able to further exploit the fragmented queue to cause an expensive linked-list walk for subsequent SACKs received for that same TCP connection. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. CVE-2019-11479: The Linux kernel is vulnerable to a flaw that allows attackers to send a crafted packets with low MSS values to trigger excessive resource consumption. An attacker can force the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of which contains only 8 bytes of data. This drastically increases the bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data. This attack requires continued effort from the attacker and the impacts will end shortly after the attacker stops sending traffic. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.\n        ",
