It consists in downgrading the connection's encryption from \"strong\" RSA to \"export-grade\" RSA, by leveraging a vulnerability (CVE-2015-0204) on the client side.The \"export-grade\" encryption is weak enough to be broken by the attacker, who can then decipher and alter the connection.\n        ",
