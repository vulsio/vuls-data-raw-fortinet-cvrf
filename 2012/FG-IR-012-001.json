Update March 26, 2012: FortiOS 4.3.6 is now available. Firmware images can be obtained from https://support.fortinet.com . The following precautions are also recommended: Ensure all GUI sessions use encryption (via HTTPS); Configure the FortiGate to only allow GUI admin access from trusted hosts or networks; If administrative access to FortiGates is required from untrusted hosts, SSH access is recommended as SSH is not affected; Refrain from administering FortiGate appliances from untrusted or shared computers. For more information, customers are encouraged to contact Customer Support at support@fortinet.com\n        ",
